Weight Converter:

Tech Stack:
Python 3.x

A simple Python script that converts weight between kilograms and pounds based on user input. This tool now accepts both uppercase and lowercase input for units (K/k and P/p).

Features:
- Convert **kilograms (K/k)** to **pounds (Lbs)**
- Convert **pounds (P/p)** to **kilograms (Kgs)**
- Handles **invalid input** gracefully
- Accepts **both uppercase and lowercase** unit inputs

How It Works:
1. The user enters a weight value.
2. The user specifies the unit: `K/k` for kilograms or `P/p` for pounds.
3. The program converts the weight accordingly and displays the result.




Example Usage:

Enter your weight: 70
Kilograms or pounds? (K or P): k
Your weight is 154.35 Lbs


Enter your weight: 150
Kilograms or pounds? (K or P): p
Your weight is 68.03 Kgs
